{"name":"Slomograb","tagline":"Cross-platform stop-motion frame grabber with IPWebcam Remote","body":"# Simple frame grabber using IPWebcam Remote Camera (Android)\r\n\r\nMy son (and myself) both love trying to make stop-motion Lego movies but there\r\nis an absolute dearth of good free applications out there.  I aim to remedy\r\nthat with a cross-platform binary (under development) that uses D-lang and\r\nVibe.d, this little utility was a proof of concept to get me into learning the\r\nlibraries more and also to prove that I could actually grab an image from\r\nIPWebcam Remote.\r\n\r\n# Building it\r\n\r\nBuild the binary as shown, this is for OS X:\r\n\r\n    dmd -L/usr/lib/libcurl.dylib main.d\r\n\r\nYou may have to fiddle with that to work on other systems.\r\n\r\nOnce it is built, copy it somewhere that it can be found on the system file\r\npath, on my iMac that is:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo cp slomograb /usr/local/bin/slomograb\r\n\r\n# Using it.\r\n\r\nHaving copied it on the path, you should then run IPCamera and note the address\r\nit gives you: for me that usually turns out to be something like:\r\nhttp://192.168.0.8:8080, you can then do:\r\n\r\n    $ slomograb 192.168.0.8:8080\r\n\r\nThis will take a high-resolution picture using the settings you have in effect\r\nand save it in the current working directory. The filename will be\r\nfNNNNNNNN.jpg and it will automatically find the largest of frames before\r\nsaving it. Each invocation produces a higer frame:\r\n\r\n    f00000001.jpg\r\n    f00000002.jpg\r\n    f00000003.jpg\r\n      :\r\n\r\nWhat you do with it after that is up to you, I use ffmpeg to stitch them\r\ntogether into the final sequence for now and then the clip is imported into\r\niMovie for editing. The script \"stitch\" is also in this project and shows how\r\nto use ffmpeg to do just that, again on OSX. Again, copy `stitch` into a\r\nplace like `usr/local/bin` so it can be run from anywhere.\r\n\r\n# Working Practice\r\n\r\nFor each sequence / scene you are going to shoot, create a folder called\r\n\"scene_NAME\", then I \"cd\" into that and get ready for a shoot... when\r\neverything is ready, issue the command to grab a frame, rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nAt any time you can just use the \"stitch\" command and then watch it, I do it like this:\r\n\r\n     $ stitch && open clip.mp4\r\n\r\nWhich on my Mac will glue them and then open Quicktime for playback.\r\n\r\nSo, there we have it, the beginnings of a simple stop-motion tool chain that is\r\nin theory at least, cross platform thanks to the power of D-lang.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
